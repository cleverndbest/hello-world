TikTokBoostAI Bot

Overview

TikTokBoostAI is a Python-based automation bot designed to help users grow their TikTok presence by automating actions such as following users, liking posts, and commenting on videos. This bot uses the TikTokApi library, which interfaces with TikTok's platform, allowing for efficient automation of various engagement actions.

Please note: The use of this bot may violate TikTok's terms of service, so it is essential to use it responsibly and in accordance with TikTok's guidelines.

Features

Follow Users: Automatically follow a TikTok user by their username.

Like Posts: Automatically like TikTok videos by their video ID.

Comment on Posts: Automatically leave comments on TikTok videos.

Time Delay: Actions are spaced out using time delays to simulate human behavior and reduce the chance of being flagged as spam.

Customizable: Users can modify the bot's actions, such as the username to follow or the videos to like or comment on.

Example Code

Here’s a basic example of what the bot’s functionality looks like:

from TikTokApi import TikTokApi
import time

# Initialize the TikTok API
api = TikTokApi.get_instance()

# Function to follow a user by their username
def follow_user(username):
    user = api.get_user(username)
    if user:
        user_id = user['user_id']
        api.follow_user(user_id)
        print(f"Following {username}")
    else:
        print(f"User {username} not found")

# Function to like a post by its TikTok ID
def like_post(tiktok_id):
    post = api.get_video_by_id(tiktok_id)
    if post:
        api.like(post)
        print(f"Liked post {tiktok_id}")
    else:
        print(f"Post {tiktok_id} not found")

# Function to comment on a post
def comment_on_post(tiktok_id, comment_text):
    post = api.get_video_by_id(tiktok_id)
    if post:
        api.comment(post, comment_text)
        print(f"Commented on post {tiktok_id}: {comment_text}")
    else:
        print(f"Post {tiktok_id} not found")

# Main function
def main():
    follow_user("some_tiktok_user")
    time.sleep(2)

    like_post("some_tiktok_video_id")
    time.sleep(2)

    comment_on_post("some_tiktok_video_id", "This is an awesome video!")

# Run the bot
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
